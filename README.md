## Exploratory Data Analysis: The Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health<br><br>

### Project Overview
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine how remote, hybrid, and onsite work environments affect productivity, mental health, and employee satisfaction. The dataset includes various factors such as work location, mental health conditions, stress levels, work-life balance, and more.

### Objectives
Analyze the relationship between work location and productivity.
Explore the connection between remote work and mental health conditions.
Understand how factors like physical activity, sleep quality, and access to mental health resources impact stress levels and satisfaction.
Identify any significant patterns or trends in the data related to work location.
### Data
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle: Remote Work and Mental Health Dataset [1]. It includes 5000 records with features like:

<ul>
<li>Age, Gender, Job Role, Industry</li>
<li>Work location (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite)</li>
<li>Mental Health Condition, Stress Level</li>
<li>Work-life balance, Physical Activity, Sleep Quality</li>
</ul>
  
### Analysis & Key Insights
Hybrid work showed the most stable productivity outcomes.
Remote work can lead to varied productivity and satisfaction, depending on job role and individual circumstances.
Poor sleep quality and lack of physical activity are correlated with higher stress levels.
### Tools Used
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Google Colab
### How to Use
Clone this repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how EDA can be used to uncover insights on the impact of different work environments on employee well-being.
